# Naive Bayes from Scratch

Bullet points for bayes rules and underlining theory for Naive Bayes is written in [NaiveBayes.md](https://github.com/YuZhangIsCoding/ML_SelfLearning/blob/master/NaiveBayes/NaiveBayes.md).

Implementation with examples is in [NaiveBayes.ipynb](https://github.com/YuZhangIsCoding/ML_SelfLearning/blob/master/NaiveBayes/NaiveBayes.ipynb)

Also [NaiveBayes.py](https://github.com/YuZhangIsCoding/ML_SelfLearning/blob/master/NaiveBayes/NaiveBayes.py) can be imported as module for feature use.
